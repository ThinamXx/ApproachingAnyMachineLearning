# **Supervised and Unsupervised Learning**  

The [**Supervised Unsupervised**](https://github.com/ThinamXx/ApproachingAnyMachineLearning/blob/main/01.%20Supervised%20Unsupervised%20Learning/Supervised%20Unsupervised.ipynb) notebook contains all the fundamental dependencies required to understand Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, Cross Validation, Decision Trees, Classification and Regression.

**Cross Validation:**
- **Cross Validation** is a step in the process of building a machine learning model which helps us to ensure that our models fit the data accurately and also ensures that we do not overfit. I have presented the implementation of Decision Tree Classifier and Model Evaluation here in the snapshot.

**KFold Cross Validation:**
- I have presented the implementation of Distribution of Labels and Stratified KFold here in the snapshot.
